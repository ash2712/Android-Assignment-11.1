To display information from a SQlite database, we use an interface known as Cursor. To use it, first a writable version of the 
database is declared and the cursor is initaialized using a built in method known as rawQuery. Then built in methods like getBlob, getInt,
getColumnIndex are used to determine the location and type of the data that is to be obtained. This data is then stored in a variable 
which can be used later.
